@brief: A global planner module installed locally in each agent. It provides functions talking
    to the multiagent global planner installed in server side, sending the compute_path request
    and receive back the solution specifically for the current agent. The multiagent global planner
    in server side computes paths for all agents at the same time for coordination.
